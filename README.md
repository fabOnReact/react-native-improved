# react-native-improved

Improved React Components, currently only Text (Android).

## Installation

**IMPORTANT**: to use this package you need to apply a patch to react-native-renderer for dev and prop. The patch is available [here](https://github.com/fabriziobertoglio1987/react-native-improved/blob/main/example/patches/react-native%2B0.73.0%2B001%2Bfix-renderer-text-runtime.patch) and is applied with patch-package to react-native 0.73. There is a facebook/react PR to address this issue.

```sh
npm install react-native-improved
```

## Usage

```js
import { TextImproved } from 'react-native-improved';

// ...

<TextImproved>A new text with additional fixes</Text>;
```
